# The Freshman Express
## Group Members: Amiteash, Máté, Meera, and Shanaia

## Project Description
This is a video blog detailing a freshman's experiences at NYU Abu Dhabi. It shows his journey not just as a student but as a vlogger as well, as he upskills in speaking, directing, filming, and editing.
### Overall Concept and Theme
We wanted to give a very homely blog-like feel to the website, something that could be seen as the creation of a freshman. The videos are hosted on a separate type of website that aims to be our version of YouTube or other popular video sharing/streaming sites. 
### Desired Experience
We wanted a design interactivity which was basic and familiar to the audience, so we went with a website design similar to that of blogs hosted by Blogger or WordPress. The video site forms the bulk of the interactivity, with the ability to not just play the video but also to give a like and view the Metadata for each video.

## Process: 
### Brainstorming
For the initial brainstorming, we wanted to go for a video idea that looked good, was relatively easy to record with our present skills, and which would mesh well with an interactive website. We all suggested possible ideas before landing on our present one, the story of a student (later decided to be a freshman) documenting their experiences on campus. We also wanted there to be a growth in the quality and content from one video to another to show that they were learning and upskilling over the simulated months. This idea also served as a meta commentary on our own experiences in this class as we learn and grow.
### Implementation
#### Pre-Production
First, we decided on what kind of quality of content and video we were aiming for each of the four videos, in order to show growth. Next, each of us prepared a script for a video, keeping in mind the quality specifications. This ensured a general diversity of content, as would be expected from a "YouTube channel".

#### Production
Once we were done with the scripts, we decided on the casting for the film, withAmiteash acting as our yet unnamed protagonist and Máté as Professor Matt. We then used the Arts Center's Music Practice Room to film the stationary scenes (the life hacks and the interview) using a BlackMagic Pocket Cinema Camera 4K and a tripod. Voices were recorded using the microphones on an iPhone 10. We then used the timelapse mode on the BlackMagic camera to film Shanaia and Meera for the life hacks video.

After we were done using the camera, we decided to film the first 2 videos on an iPhone 10. The first video was filmed in selfie mode and the second was filmed in regular landscape mode using the phone's main camera. The first video was filmed especially shakily to convey a sense of being new to the world of filming.

#### Post-Production and Web Design
All of the videos were then edited using Adobe Premiere Pro. Videos 3 and 4 were carefully matched with the recorded audioto make sure that the video and audio were in sync. We also cut any extraneous bits and made the cuts and transitions smoother.

Concurrently we worked on the website's design. As we mentioned earlier, we went with a very Blogger-like style for the main website. Our color theme was inspired by the NYU purple (#VioletPride). We also made a clear distinction between the left side of the page containing blog posts that linked to the videos, and the right side which had the About and the menu that showed the months of each post.

For the video website, although the four videos are hosted on four different sites, they all have the same CSS and Javascript to control their appearance and behavior. For these websites, we went with a style similar to that of YouTube, yet pretty different. We decided to call this site vids4you. Each video has a like, share, and metadata button which are all interactive. The views, likes, and shares are all linked to counters that increment regularly based on a seed that is different for each video.

## Reflection/Evaluation: 
We feel that our expectations have been met in this project. We have good videos, and a great website hosting them. We all worked very well as a team on this project, with each of us contributing our strengths. Some of the more challenging parts we faced were regarding the lighting for the videos, recording the sound, and suitably compressing the final mp4 videos for hosting on our website.
Overall, we are happy with this project, and we learned a lot about filming and editing while making it.
