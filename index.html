						<p>Hello Fellow Travelers!</p>

						<p>The next episode of The Freshman Express will be my most ambitious one yet. I had an exclusive interview with the newest professor from the Computer Science department, Prof. Matt Hackfuse. How exciting! The whole thing is about an hour, and it's taking forever to edit haha ... But have no fear, I have a <a href = "video4.html">trailer for you</a> with snippets from the interview!</p>

						<p>As usual, you’ll be able to watch the full interview on vids4you! Tune in and subscribe to get a notification when it comes out!</p>

					<p class = "author">by <span style="font-weight: bold;">ABHIJEET RAY</span> - January 28, 2022</p>
					<div class = "content">
						<p>Hello Fellow Travelers!</p>

						<p>Phew! Who knew that another Covid variant would cancel our J-Terms (a short term in January) and hold us back again, huh? I’m sorry that this video got delayed for so long. I just wasn't able to get back to campus until today. But, let’s head on!</p>

						<p>For my latest video, I will present to you three must-know life hacks for any NYUAD student. These hacks are things which seem very simple, but yet often stump students when experiencing them for the first time. So, why don’t you head to my channel now and check the video out? I’m sure it will be informative!</p>
